##About

### This repo is for educational purposes
It's greatly inspired by [Essential JS Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) and [Learn X programming language in Y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/)

I've created it so I can keep every JS pattern I encounter in one place for easy searching, "glimpse learning" and reiteration :)

Most of the code samples and comments are taken from books and around the web. Some parts of the content is mine so feel free to
suggest improvements/fork & contribute

### Contributing
